You are a Principal Enterprise Architect, Cloud Architect, and Senior Engineer.

Your task is to generate a COMPLETE, REAL, WORKING,
CLOUD-NATIVE BANKING PLATFORM
built on AZURE using MICROSERVICES.

This is NOT a tutorial.
This is a REAL ENTERPRISE-GRADE PROJECT
that can be pushed to GitHub and shown to recruiters and architects.

==================================================
PROJECT GOAL
==================================================

Build a FULL-FLEDGED BANKING SYSTEM similar to:
- ICICI Bank
- HDFC Bank
- Citi Bank

The system must demonstrate:
- Scalability
- Resiliency
- Security
- Observability
- Correctness (no duplicate transactions)

==================================================
ROOT GITHUB REPOSITORY (MUST CREATE)
==================================================

cloud-native-banking-platform-azure

==================================================
VERY IMPORTANT STRUCTURE RULE
==================================================

The repository MUST contain:

A) THEORY & ARCHITECTURE (docs/)
B) FULL SOURCE CODE (frontend + backend)
C) INFRA & DEPLOYMENT (AKS, Helm, Istio)
D) OPERATIONS & RUNBOOKS

Theory MUST explain WHY.
Code MUST prove HOW.
Docs MUST reference exact code paths.

==================================================
REPOSITORY STRUCTURE (MANDATORY)

==================================================
SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY (MANDATORY)
==================================================

Banking use cases:
- Create account
- Check balance
- Transfer money
- Make payment
- Transaction history

Frontend:
- Simple UI to initiate banking operations
- Calls backend APIs

Backend (.NET Core microservices):
1) AccountService
   - Manages accounts
   - Azure SQL
2) TransactionService
   - Records transactions
   - Azure SQL
   - Publishes events
3) PaymentService
   - Processes payments
   - Handles idempotency & duplicates
4) NotificationService
   - Async consumer
   - Sends notifications

==================================================
COMMUNICATION
==================================================

- Sync: REST + gRPC
- Async: Azure Service Bus
- DB per service (Azure SQL)

==================================================
OBSERVABILITY (MANDATORY)
==================================================

Implement:
- Structured JSON logs
- Correlation IDs
- Fluent Bit → Elasticsearch → Kibana
- Prometheus metrics
- Grafana dashboards
- Istio / Envoy telemetry

==================================================
DEPLOYMENT & PLATFORM
==================================================

- Docker per service
- Azure Container Registry
- AKS
- Helm charts per service
- Istio service mesh
- Blue-Green & Canary deployments

==================================================
DUPLICATE & CONSISTENCY HANDLING (CRITICAL)
==================================================

Implement:
- Idempotency keys at API layer
- Service Bus duplicate detection
- Database unique constraints
- Exactly-once illusion handling

==================================================
DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS (docs/)
==================================================

Each doc must explain:
- WHY this component exists
- WHY this pattern was chosen
- WHY alternatives were rejected
- HOW this behaves under load/failure
- HOW banks handle this in real life

Include:
- Architecture diagrams (ASCII)
- Request flow diagrams
- Sequence diagrams
- Failure scenarios

==================================================
OPERATIONS & RUNBOOKS
==================================================

Include:
- How to monitor after go-live
- How to trace a failed transaction
- How to debug duplicate payments
- How to rollback safely
- How to scale during peak hours

==================================================
INTERVIEW PREPARATION
==================================================

Provide:
- 2-minute architecture explanation
- Common LTI Round-2 questions
- Trap questions & strong answers
- How to walk interviewer through GitHub repo

==================================================
FINAL EXPECTATION
==================================================

This project must allow someone to:
- Clone repo
- Run services locally
- Deploy to AKS
- Observe logs & metrics
- Simulate failures
- Explain architecture confidently

DO NOT:
- Skip code
- Put everything only in markdown
- Oversimplify like a demo
